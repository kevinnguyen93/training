The Flatlanders need a store to sell their gems and more! They need it really quick, Angular will do the trick!

They have figured out how to manipulate time and space, allowing them to create three-dimensional gems. The buying and selling of their gems has become a popular Flatlander practice and they believe the next step is taking their wonderful wares to the fourth dimension (the web).
